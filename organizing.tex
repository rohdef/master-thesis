\section{Introduction}

For organizing {\bibtex} files the following is covered: how to
organize in principle \chapref{sec:organizing_principle}, how to
organize in practice \chapref{sec:organizing_practice}, what the
choices for the prototype {\orangutan} is
\chapref{sec:organizing_orangutan_what}, how {\orangutan} handles it
in principle \chapref{sec:organizing_orangutan_how_principle}, and how
{\orangutan} handle it in practice
\chapref{sec:organizing_orangutan_how_practice}


\section{Organizing in general}

\subsection{In principle}
\label{sec:organizing_principle}

Having found the issues that are possible, a way to react to them is
needed.  Correcting is either done by changing the entries to a state,
where the analysis cannot find any more issues, or by using the
configurations to tell the analysis that the issues are false
positives.

There are two basic ways of reacting to the issues, one
automatically correcting them and the other is to present the issues
and have one decide what to do.  As pointed out in the problem
descriptions, it is hard, if not impossible, to automatically correct,
since it can lead to incorrect changes and thus introduce a new
structural issue.  Thus the organizing is done by presenting the
issues, letting the user decide on the action to take.

When presenting the user with the issues there are again two
approaches: letting one do a range of choices to handle the issues
finally outputting a corrected \file{bib}, or giving a list of issues
and suggestions for corrections.  The last one requires the user to
manually edit his \file{bib}, and if the issues are listed with line
numbers, they should be listed backwards, so the lines will be correct
throughout the correction.

After all the concerns has been addressed a pretty printing utility
will be a nice final touch, ensuring a consistent structure inside ones
\file{bib} and having the same indentations and formatting.

\subsection{In practice}
\label{sec:organizing_practice}

When multiple suggestions are available all the alternatives should be
given to the user.  All suggestions should include a way to find the
violating entry, \ie, either the entry key or a location in the file.
For all the detected issues it should suggest using the relevant
configurations from Section~\ref{sec:analyzing_configuration}, with
exception of the ones to disable entire checks, \ie,
\texttt{@LEXICALLYOK}, \texttt{@CONSISTENCYOK} and \texttt{@OK}.  The
suggestions that the tool gives should be as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item For duplicate entries, it should suggest: merging the entries,
  updating the content of one of the entries, and adding a de-facto
  configuration to mark the duplication as deliberate.  In the case
  where a merge is not possible or if the online lookup contains
  additional information, it should also suggest the result from an
  online lookup.  For duplicated content it should suggest using
  \texttt{crossref} when relevant and otherwise changing the content
  to make use of strings.

\item For general spelling errors it should inform about the
  misspelled word and show the suggestions from the spell checker.
  Furthermore, if online lookups are used to prevent false positives,
  the result from those should also be presented.

\item For spelling errors in names it should only show the names that
  cannot be verified using databases.  Then it should show the name or
  names that gives challenges, and if possible suggestions from the
  name databases.

\item Initials should be presented to the user, and if possible,
  suggestions from the name databases.

\item Whenever online lookups are used, if there are suggestions, they
  should be presented to the user, along with the option to disable
  the online lookups.  This presentation should also be the case when
  the lookup is a part of another tool.

\item For name changes, it should suggest usage of a de-facto standard
  to highlight this, following the rule of suggesting only names
  actively used in the document, and suggesting the latest name, prior
  to the current entry.  If the entry is from the earliest instance of
  the forum in the file, no suggestions should be made.

\item De-facto standards and specification conformance should result
  in information about the deviations from standards, \ie, if a field
  is missing this should be marked with the suggestion of adding it,
  if a field is not specified or has been marked with deny it should
  suggest removal.  In the case of exclusive and inclusive fields
  where both are missing it should suggest an alternative action.  For
  the case of exclusive fields where both are present, it should
  suggest removing one of the violating fields.  Furthermore, it
  should show if the validation of the values fail, and if possible
  where in the check they fail.  It should also show the suggestions
  from any online lookups to provide possible corrections.

\item For abbreviations it should suggest changing to usage of
  strings, if the values are written as text.  It should suggest
  changing the content of the strings to either full names or
  abbreviated forms depending on the desired format for the user.

\item When detecting possible strings that ended up in text it should
  suggest either changing the entire text to a string, if it is the
  entire text that matches the name of the string and otherwise
  splitting the text, concatenating the matched string with the rest
  of the text.  If a text has a string representation it should
  suggest removing the text and replacing it with the string,
  concatenating it with the rest of the text, if relevant.

\item For inconsistent tags it should suggest the shortest path to
  consistency, whether it is by removing tags or adding tags to the
  entries.

\item When entry keys are inconsistent with the specified pattern, it
  should suggest replacing the entry key with the value that matches
  the pattern.
\end{itemize}

By following these instructions, it should at all times be possible to
reach a point where the analysis does not show any more issues.


\section{\orangutan}

\subsection{What}
\label{sec:organizing_orangutan_what}

{\orangutan} is designed as a framework rather as an end user
application.  The output it gives is the suggestions coming from the
analysis.  For instance, a tool listing the suggestions in a backward
order, for manual editing.


\subsection{How in principle}
\label{sec:organizing_orangutan_how_principle}

The output given in JSON, which most programming frameworks support.
The output can be in a trimmed version showing only the detected
issues or in a full version containing all the entries.  Thus the
output be used for listing only the issues, or for printing an entire
corrected {\bibtex} file after choosing the desired solutions.


\subsection{How in practice}
\label{sec:organizing_orangutan_how_practice}

{\orangutan} gives back a JSON string containing at least the entries
with detected issues.  If configured to do so, it keeps the entries
without issues.  For the entries in the output that has issues an
object is attached with the name \texttt{orangutan} detailing the
specific issues and suggestions.

All detected issues will be put in an object named $orangutan$ on the
internal object for the entry.  Having the corrections along the
object, will allow printing the corrected entry, once an action has
been decided on.  Effectively the $orangutan$ object functions as a
map or dictionary, having an item for each entry tag with detected
issues, and an object containing the details of the issues.

The spell checker will add an object named $spelling$ to the object
with issues.  It contains the details from the spell check: how many
words it checked $wordCount$, how many misspellings it found
$misspellingCount$ and most importantly a list named $misspellings$
for the details from the spell checker.  Each item in $misspellings$
is an object consisting of: the misspelled word in $word$, the
position of the misspelled word in $position$ and a list of
suggestions inside $alternatives$.  An example of a spelling error can
be seen in \figref{fig:orgazing_misspelling_output}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{minted}{json}
{
  "title": {
    "spelling": {
      "wordCount": 3,
      "misspellingCount": 1,
      "misspellings": [
        [{
          "type": "misspelling",
          "word": "Algoritm",
          "position": 10,
          "alternatives": [
            "Algorithm",
            "Alacrity",
            "Ageratum",
            "Alacrity's" ]
        }]
      ]
    }
  }
}
\end{minted}
\caption{An example of Orangutan output on a spelling error}
\label{fig:orgazing_misspelling_output}
\end{figure}

\remark{Now does it actually check for unknown entry types???}

When checking for correctness it marks entries according to the
{\bibtex} specification and de-facto standards.  This check is named
conformance check.  The output specifies when an entry type or a tag
is in violation with the rules specified.  The conformance checker
adds an object for the tags with conformance errors to the $orangutan$
object.  The object for the tag will then have an object named
$specificationConformance$ containing a description of the issue and a
code corresponding.  In \figref{fig:orgazing_nonconformity} an example
of a violation of an exclusive rule can be seen.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{minted}{json}
{
  "author": {
    "specificationConformance": {
      "description": "[author] and [editor] cannot be in the same entry",
      "code": 3,
      "field": "editor"
    }
  },
  "editor": {
    "specificationConformance": {
      "description": "[editor] and [author] cannot be in the same entry",
      "code": 3,
      "field": "author"
    }
  }
}
\end{minted}
\caption{An example of Orangutan output on a conformity error where
  the exclusive ruse have been violated}
\label{fig:orgazing_nonconformity}
\end{figure}

The current version just suggest the full name whenever an
abbreviation is detected.  Builds a structure with suggestions for
full names when an abbreviations is detected.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{minted}{json}
{
  "journal": {
    "abbreviations": {
      "abbreviation": [
        "am. j. potato res."
      ],
      "suggestions": {
        "am. j. potato res.": [
          "American Journal of Potato Research"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
\end{minted}
\caption{An example of Orangutan output on a conformity error where

\section{Summary and conclusion}

Using the results from the analysis of a \file{bib}, sensible
suggestions for a course of action can be provided.  For most results
a straight forward solution can be provided, such as the correct
spelling of a word.  The output from the prototype {\orangutan} have a
proof of concept for this, providing out that can be used to take a
course of action.
