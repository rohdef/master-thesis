\section{BibTeX format}
BibTeX is a commonly used format for managing lists of references in
academic circles \remark{Now now, can we prove this?}.  The format is
designed for use with {\LaTeX}, but plugins for other formats do
exist. \autocite{bibtex_resource}

The format itself is fairly simple, at it's main level we got
$@STING$, $@PREAMPLE$, $@COMMENT$ and $entries$.  $@STRING$ is for
abbreviations that can be used later in the BibTeX, $@PREAMPLE$ is for
defining how to format the text and $@COMMENT$ is for comments and
$entries$ are the actual entries \autocite{bibtex_resource}.

Since $@PREAMPLE$ and $@COMMENT$ doesn't affect the contents they
won't be considered further in this document. \remark{Double check
  preample, recall reading somewhere that it's just LaTeX macros.}

Tags is case insensitive. If the contents needs to be enclosed in
either \{ and \} or quotes (depending on the persons taste), numbers
can be written without them and @sting abbreviations has to be without
them. Concatenation is done using \#.\autocite{bibtex_resource}

(Note to self:) should probably have half an eye on things like:  `G{\"o}del', when working with it
(Note to self:) people may use booktitle where title is appropriate
edition: The edition of a book---for example, ``Second''. This should be an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown here; the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary. \autocite{bibtex_description}
