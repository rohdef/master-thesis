{\bibtex} is a software tool for handling bibliographic
references in {\LaTeX} documents.  For example, this dissertation is
formatted in {\LaTeX} and its bibliographic references are handled
with {\bibtex}.  In this dissertation, we document an automated method for
detecting lexical issues and inconsistencies in {\bibtex} files.

To this end, we successively describe {\bibtex} -- both how to use it
in principle and how it is used in practice (Chapter~\ref{ch:about}),
we review a range of practical issues {\bibtex} users encounter
(Chapter~\ref{ch:problem-description}), we propose an approach to
handling these issues (Chapter~\ref{ch:approach}), and we review how
they are tackled in related work (Chapter~\ref{ch:related}).  We then
propose a way to analyze {\bibtex} files to detect these issues
(Chapter~\ref{ch:analyzing}), and how to organize {\bibtex} files
using the results from this analysis (Chapter~\ref{ch:organizing}).
