method for detecting lexical issues and inconsistencies in {\bibtex}
files.

The subjects covered are: a description of {\bibtex}
(Chapter~\ref{ch:about}), a range of challenges encountered when
working with {\bibtex} (Chapter~\ref{ch:problem-description}), an
approach to handling the issues in {\bibtex}
(Chapter~\ref{ch:approach}), related work (Chapter~\ref{ch:related}),
how to analyze {\bibtex} files to detect the issues
(Chapter~\ref{ch:analyzing}), and how organize {\bibtex} files to
handle the issues (Chapter~\ref{ch:organizing}).
