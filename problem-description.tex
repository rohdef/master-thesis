\section{Introduction}
The goal of this chapter is to introduce the challenges of {\bibtex}
by showing concrete examples.  The terms of discourse, structural and
conjunctural, will be defined
\chapref{sec:problems_structural_conjunctural}.  The use of de-facto
standards and conformity to the {\bibtex} specification will be
covered \chapref{sec:problems_de_facto}.  The problems with: journal
abbreviations \chapref{sec:problems_abbreviations}, inconsistent tags
\chapref{sec:problems_inconsistent_tags}, duplicate entries
\chapref{sec:problems_duplicates}, online look ups
\chapref{sec:problems_look_ups}, inconsistent entry keys
\chapref{sec:problems_inconsistent_keys}, name changes in for instance
conference names \chapref{sec:problems_name_changes}, covering the
issues of initials \chapref{sec:problems_initials}, spelling errors
\chapref{sec:problems_spelling} and {\bibtex} strings that end up in
the text \chapref{sec:problems_strings_as_text} will be covered.

\section{Structural vs conjunctural issues}
\label{sec:problems_structural_conjunctural}

Unfortunately, even though {\bibtex} has made life a lot better for
scientific authors, it is far from perfect and there are a lot of
issues that can be found.  Inspired by economics, the challenges in
{\bibtex} can be divided into structural and conjunctural issues. 

\begin{itemize}
\item The structural issues are the ones intrinsic to {\bibtex}, thus
  it is caused by the design, the standard tools for {\bibtex} and
  information that can not be found.

\item The conjunctural issues are the combination of circumstances,
  for instance if the source used does not the complete information
  (\eg, extracting a references from an article where the author only
  have initials even though the full name is known) or the users
  having other priorities than bibliographies.
\end{itemize}

Whether an issue is seen as conjunctural or structural is in part a
matter of opinion, as the definitions can be stretched in either
direction - an issue also faced in economics.  Most of the issues are
arguably a combination the two as they could be fixed by careful labor
or by having the right tools available, \eg, most bibliography
managers have tools to switch between abbreviated and full journal
names. 

Addressing the human factor, \ie, a conjunctural solution, is one
theoretically possibile way of solving these issues.  ``Simply''
motivating people to do things right.  Alas people are not machines
and thus this approach will be impossible in practice, for most people
the interest is not the tools they use but what they use them for, so
the interest in {\bibtex} will for most people being in ensuring that
their articles contain the relevant references.

Since a conjunctural solution is not realistic, the goal is to provide
a structural solution to the issues.  In the perfect world the
structural solution will be so complete that if there is any issues
left then they will be entirely conjunctural, because one is either:
not using or misusing the structural solution.


\section{De-facto standards and specification conformity}
\label{sec:problems_de_facto}

An interesting point is that not all of the structural issues are
necessarily bad.  There are a lot of ways to make use of the relaxed
properties of {\bibtex}, for instance that by design {\bibtex} ignores
unknown tags is useful in de-facto standards such as commenting
entries out by prefixing with $OPT$ or adding information that are not
a part of the {\bibtex} specification, such as ISSN, DOI or the
crossref, which is technically not specified by {\bibtex} but still is
part of the tool.  In \figref{fig:mendeley_output}, an example is
provided by a PhD student from the Chemistry Department at Aarhus
University, this example is created from Mendeley (see
Section~\ref{sec:related_mendeley}) and shows a lot of additional
information about the article.

\begin{figure}

          and Young, D P and Moldovan, M and Chan, Julia Y

}
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
  \caption{Output from Mendeley containing additional information}
\label{fig:mendeley_output}
\end{figure}

This design choice is an issue, if strict conformity to the
specification is desired, however as it is a very practical and widely
used feature a strict validation would be counterproductive.  Also
some formatting styles actually make use of some of the unspecified
tags as can be seen in \figref{fig:entry_with_issn}. It is still
interesting to find tags that do not conform to the specification and
the de-facto standards in use, thus treating de-facto standards as a
feature and only treating further deviations as actual issues seems to
make most sense.

\section{Journal abbreviations}
\label{sec:problems_abbreviations}

\remark{Wouldn't forum abbreviations be more appropriate?}

\remark{Hmm, comment that abbreviations follow standards}

Most, if not all, journals require that journal names should be
abbreviated when publishing.  However internally in the {\bibtex} file
the owner's personal priorities are: consistent and correct naming.
As {\bibtex} can be seen as a database of references, it would make
most sense to consider full names as the most correct and the
abbreviations to be a matter of formatting.  Unfortunately {\bibtex}
does not handle abbreviations at all, which for instance is apparent
in articles from arXiv.org, as can be seen in the bbl output in
\figref{fig:inconsistent_naming}.

  \caption{Inconsistent naming of journal and conference names}
\label{fig:inconsistent_naming}
\end{figure}

From the point of view that the style of {\bibtex} should format
abbreviations properly, the issue seen here is structural.  In cases
where the abbreviation is wrong (\eg, due to a typo), the issue would
move towards being conjunctural again, unless some kind of
abbreviation specific spell checker is being used.  Using full names
and then formatting them accordingly seems like the most sensible
idea, since the style of abbreviation could be interchanged, should
the need arise, it is more readable and it would create better
conditions for output tools to provide consistent formatting.

Currently there are multiple strategies for ensuring consistency in
abbreviations, some do a search and replace on the bib-file depending
on the formatting they need, an approach that is a bit more structured
is the use of strings in {\bibtex} to ensure a consistent naming of a
journal which can further be combined with the usage of crossref.
Another approach is the use of Bib{\LaTeX} and biber, which provide
the solution in the formatting
options\cite{koppensteiner2011abbreviate}, provided that the
abbreviation handing of the style is correct.  This causes it to
become a more conjunctural issue, as the issue now is if the right
names are written, however how conjunctural depends on the correctness
of the tools.  Bibliography managers (see
Section~\ref{sec:bibliography_managers}) such as JabRef, Mendeley
etc. tend to go with the strategy that it stores the references using
full names and then exports it to a {\bibtex} file (or whatever format
one decide to export to) having the desired abbreviation style applied
to the export, this strategy moves the issue towards being
conjunctural, for the same reasons as the Bib{\LaTeX} and biber
solution.

As the purpose is to work on the {\bibtex} files, the formatting in
the end is technically not the primary concern.  The concern would
optimally just be to ensure a consistent document, so the style can do
its work.  Since {\bibtex} styles currently does not take care of
abbreviations directly, there might be the need for considerations on
how to easily and consistently ensuring abbreviations according to a
desired format.  Having a solution that ensures a consistent
structure, which is easy to modify to a desired style of
abbreviations, would move the issue towards the conjunctural.  Having
the styles actually handling the abbreviations (such as the
Bib{\LaTeX} and biber combination does) would make the issue entirely
conjunctural if there is a an easy way to ensure that all journal
names, conference names etc. are always in correct full names.

\section{Inconsistent tags}
\label{sec:problems_inconsistent_tags}

Take the inconsistency in \figref{fig:entry_with_issn}, found in a
article on arXiv.org: two references from the same conference, but
different years.  The inconsistency is easy to identify due to the
consistent naming, which will make the issue even more visible to the
reader.  Correct and consistent naming will make it possible for tools
to detect inconsistencies when some fields are missing.  This exposes
a structural part of the issue, as no such tools exist (to the
authors knowledge).

The ISSN might not exist for the $MuKoJansson2009AoPA$-entry, in this
case a structural detection system might be the cause of new
structural issue, either the removal of relevant data or forcing
entries for cases where it is not relevant.  In this specific case the
search result in \figref{fig:entry_issn_found} reveals that the
missing ISSN does exist and thus a tool pointing out the inconsistency
would in this case make the issue conjunctural.

Provided a reliable way to look up correct entries a tool could move
the issues towards being conjunctural, since it would then just being a
matter of doing the lookup on all entries and then be done (apart from
the abbreviation issues above).  Take the inconsistency in
\figref{fig:inconsistent_proceedings} where two entries from the
same conference has different information.  One has an additional
``ICFP '10'' and ``ACM'' in there, the other one does not.

An online search for {\bibtex} information give the entries in

provides one possible option for a set of consistent entries.  As can
be seen $ACM$ is the name of the organization and is probably missing
in the original {\bibtex} that produced the bbl file inspected above.

\section{Duplicate entries}
\label{sec:problems_duplicates}

When a group of authors are writing on the same document work is often
divided and each author will have their own bib-file that they use for
their references.  All might be fine until the group combines their
document and it turns out that multiple authors has used the same
reference but with different keys, ending up having duplicate entries
in the bibliography.

Arguably it can be seen as a structural or a conjunctural problem.
The similarity of such entries will make them easier to spot with the
naked eye, arguably making a conjunctural solution relevant.  However
the due to the similarity (at least if abbreviated the same way) a
structural solution is arguably also easy to make.  Making the problem
purely conjunctural would require a way to detect and merge these
entries, furthermore if the entries use different key names the
corresponding document should also be corrected. A challenge in this
case is when similar entries, that are still different entries, occur.

A similar issue, which actually happened in one of the drafts for this
document, is when an author copy pastes a template for en entry with
the intend to adjust for a new entry.  Then giving it a key and
forgetting to adjust the entry.  This will also result in a duplicate
entry, but unlike the situation above the duplicate should not be
merged but contain different content.

Having a tool that just merges duplicate entries may provide a
structural solution to the first case but will create a structural
issue in the second as it will automatically introduce new issues.
Thus the solution should not merge automatically.


\section{Online look ups}
\label{sec:problems_look_ups}

In the utopic case all entries could be looked up at all times, but
this care is not likely as unpublished works would need a reliable way
to be registered.  Also even though the databases out there are really
good, most of the time, erronous results can be found.  A lookup on
Google Scholar in the beginning of February 2016 for: ``Results and
Analysis of SyGuS-Comp’15'' can be seen in
\figref{fig:scholar_bad_result}, which contains erronous output.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{verbatim}
@article{alurresults,
  title={Results and Analysis of SyGuS-Comp’15},
  author={Alur, Rajeev and Fisman, Dana and Singh, Rishabh
          and Solar-Lezama, Armando}
}
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{Bad result from Google Scholar}
\label{fig:scholar_bad_result}
\end{figure}

Having found the article originally on arXiv.org the source of the
article is known to be EPTCS - Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical
Computer Science.  So not only does the Google Scholar result actually
not conform to the requirements of an article, the resource are in
fact not an article at all, but in the proceedings to a conference.
Finding the correct entry details at the EPTCS page reveals the entry
in \figref{fig:eptcs_lookup}.  Relying blindly on these being
correct would cause structural issues as the tools could automatically
introduce new errors.  Using it for suggestions can move the issue
towards being conjunctural for most cases.

\begin{figure}

\section{Inconsistent entry keys}
\label{sec:problems_inconsistent_keys}

The naming scheme for entry keys may vary throughout a bib-file, for
instance one of the users collaborating earlier might use entries from
various online databases getting keys corresponding to
\figref{fig:missing_org_scholar_lookup} and \figref{fig:eptcs_lookup}
in one big mess.  Had the user been working alone this inconsistency
would arguably be one's own headache, after all one might not even
remember the entries by their given key. But as the user is
collaborating with others they might influenced by it.  Another
potential challenge could be avoiding duplicate key names which with a
consistent structure would be easier and a duplicate key could give an
indicator of a duplicate entry.  One of the users collaborating might
also be new to using {\bibtex} (could be a student learning) and need
to find a nice an consistent way of writing the keys.

Inconsistencies in keys might range from not a problem at all to fully
conjectural or structural, highly depending on the users point of
view.  The user who does not use they keys to search for entries may
simply not care and apart from the potential to detect duplicate
entries may not have a reason to.  However in the collaboration
scenario others might be affected by it, and an additional way of
detecting duplicates (see Section~\ref{sec:problems_duplicates}).  In
this case it arguably becomes conjunctural as the authors should have
agreed on a style - which might also have helped a newcomer to have a
good practice, but it can yet again be argued that it is structural as
{\bibtex} does not provide naming guidelines nor tools for ensuring
those.

To make this issue structural a naming convention would have to be
agreed upon and some way of enforcing it provided.  This could result
in two entries with the same key, causing a key name clash, provided
a that a solution for the duplicate entry issue is already in place a
need for way to handle key name clashes.

\section{Name changes in conferences, journals etc.}
\label{sec:problems_name_changes}

In \figref{fig:missing_org_scholar_lookup} spotting the consistency
issues were relatively simple, a tool will also be able to find it,
since the conference have the same name.  When looking at
\figref{fig:entry_journal_name_authors} it can be seen that the
conference name is slightly different in one of the entries, but so
close that they are probably the same conference.

\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
  \caption{Inconsistent reference to the conference and heavily abbreviated author names}
\label{fig:entry_journal_name_authors}
\end{figure}

A visit to the homepage of the conference reveals that ``National
Information Systems Security Conference'' used to be named ``National
Computer Security Conference'', which is probably the reason for the
$\{NIST\}--\{NCSC\}$ part of the first entry\cite{nist2014_nissc}.  In
the same source it turns out that there are also references to the
conference from before the name change, as seen in
\figref{fig:conference_name}, so to correctly identify potential
inconsistencies it should also recognize name changes and variations.

\begin{figure}

\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
  \caption{Name change of a conference}
\label{fig:conference_name}
\end{figure}

In {\bibtex} there is no way of specifying that the same conference
has different names so there is a big structural part as there is no
support for identifying this issue, furthermore the owner of the
{\bibtex} file might not even be aware which arguably could be
conjunctural as the user could do his research or structural because
the user should have a tool that can assist.  If a tool could reliably
detect inconsistencies from the same forum with different names the
name changes would become conjunctural.


\section{Initials}
\label{sec:problems_initials}

Another issue in \figref{fig:conference_name} is the list of author
names that are so heavily abbreviated to initials that one cannot
realistically distinguish who the authors are.  This might originate
from the used citation style or from a resource where they are already
abbreviated.

If the initials come from the citation style the issue is of a
structural nature.  However if it is copied from another source, or
just written like that, it is conjunctural, as the user did not ensure
full names.  A structural variant of the copying issue is if the
reference is copied by a tool, then it can be argued that such a tool
should try to detect initials.  Having a way to detect the initials
may again move the issue towards conjunctural however to make it
entirely conjunctural we would need a reliable way to know when the
initials are deliberate or not, as some people never use or reveal
that part of their name.


\section{Spelling errors}
\label{sec:problems_spelling}

In almost, if not, all cases where people type text, spelling errors
will arise sooner or later, bib-files is no exception.  Extracting
meta-information automatically from documents may also run into a a
bad extraction leading to spelling errors.  Furthermore a spelling
error might not even be in the {\bibtex} document, as the misspelling
can be from the source, for instance if a title of a document is
misspelled, then the correct {\bibtex} will have to contain this
error, as it is the title of the source.

A user typing the entries manually is arguably the cause of spelling
errors and thus it can be argued that the issue is conjunctural, since
one could just do a spell check.  However one might also argue that
{\bibtex} should do a spell check.  In the case where automatic
extraction is the source of the spelling error the tool will give a
structural component to the issue.  Having a way of ensuring a spell
check and if such a way could ensure that the spelling error
corresponds to the source would make this issue conjunctural.


\section{{\bibtex} strings ending up as text}
\label{sec:problems_strings_as_text}

When working with {\bibtex}, strings can accidentally end up being
textual content rather than a string, for instance if a user is being
careless or if the friendly PhD student earlier exports from a program
that does not make use of the strings.  In the output from the
aforementioned student seen in \figref{fig:mendeley_output} the month
is actually a text and not a string as one would expect.  The use of
text over strings prevents re-use of fragments and localization.

When the usage as text over strings come from a tool, such as in the
example above, the issue is of a structural nature, whereas when one
types it by accident then again it can arguably be both structural and
conjunctural.  Providing a structural solution to this would be by
being able to detect this and correct it.


\section{Summary and conclusions}
\label{sec:problems_conclusion}

{\bibtex} has a lot of issues which can be analyzed from the
perspective of if they are structural and conjunctural with the goal
of how the issues can become more conjunctural.  The problems covered
are:

\begin{itemize}
\item For de-facto standards and specification conformance desired to
  ensure that entries conform to the {\bibtex} specification, but
  allowing de-facto standards.
\item Journal abbreviations where they can be cumbersome for analyzing
  tools and that {\bibtex} does not handle abbreviations fully.
\item Inconsistent tag usage, resulting in non-uniform bibliographies.
\item Duplicate entries.
\item Online look ups which can contain wrong data.
\item Inconsistent entry keys which can be an issue in collaboration
  and may make it harder to detect duplicates.
\item Name change of a forum which can affect detection of
  inconsistent tag usage.
\item Use of initials can hide peoples names to the level where
  finding a resource is hard.
\item Spelling errors
\item {\bibtex} strings that end up as part of the text, in the worst
  case resulting in wrong data.
\end{itemize}

With all these problems at hand, {\bibtex} may not seem like the
optimal tool after all.  Being the widely used tool that it is, doing
something about it quite desirable.  But what can be done with such a
range of issues?
